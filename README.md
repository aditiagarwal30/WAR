# WAR

We will use Python OOP to simulate a simplified version of the game WAR. Two players will each start off with half the deck, then they each remove a card, compare which card has the highest value, and the player with the higher card wins both cards. 

If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war". Both players place the next five cards face down and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.

Whoever ends up with 0 cards will lose the game.
